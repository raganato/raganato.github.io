I am a postdoctoral researcher within the [language technology](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/) research group at the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en). I am part of the [FoTran](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/natural-language-understanding-with-cross-lingual-grounding) team led by [prof. JÃ¶rg Tiedemann](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/tiedeman/). FoTran is a project at the intersection of cross lingual Natural Language Processing and machine translation, funded by an [ERC Consolidator Grant](https://erc.europa.eu/news/erc-2017-consolidator-grants-results).

I did my PhD at the [Linguistic Computing Laboratory (LCL)](http://lcl.uniroma1.it/) of the [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en), under the supervision of [prof. Roberto Navigli](http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli/).

My research interests are, among others, semantic representation, Word Sense Disambiguation and Neural Machine Translation.
